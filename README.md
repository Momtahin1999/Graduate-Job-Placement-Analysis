# Graduate-Job-Placement-Analysis

This project, Graduate Job Placement Analysis, focuses on analyzing the job placement outcomes of over 200 college graduates, using a dataset that includes details such as academic performance, demographics, and salary offers. The goal is to assist Gazelle Recruiting in understanding trends that influence job placement success, and to explore predictive analytics methods for future placement predictions. The project involved several steps, starting with data cleansing, where missing values were handled using appropriate imputation or removal strategies. Outlier detection was performed using statistical techniques like Z-scores and Interquartile Range (IQR), and the outliers were removed to ensure the quality of analysis. Data visualizations were then created to explore key patterns, including trends in placement likelihood based on academic performance and demographics. These visualizations helped to reveal the relationships between salary offers, placement status, and other factors. In the later stages, the data was prepared for regression analysis to predict placement likelihood, where the dataset was split into training and test sets. A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the performance of the predictive model. The project also aimed to determine the factors most likely to contribute to successful job placements, providing meaningful insights for senior management. Technologies used include Python, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-Learn for building and evaluating the regression model. The results of the analysis have the potential to guide future placement decisions and provide actionable insights for Gazelle Recruiting.
